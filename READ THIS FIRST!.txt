Spanish Perverts uses an XML based loading. This access to local files is not allowed in the system and so we have to apply a small hack to the browser.

To launch Spanish-Perverts locally in Chrome, do the following steps:

1. Close all instances of Chrome
2. Open Command Prompt
3. Key in the following code: <PATH> --allow-file-access-from-files

*<PATH> is the path of your Google Chrome Browser (usually "C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe")

To make the version work you also need to edit line 95 of main.js to your own file system path to the /data folder.

Or if you really can't do all this to play the game, just visit

Enjoy!
